Yeah! I am Noob, especially in MERN Stack. So, a random day I just thought let's make notes and quick snippets so that next time I don't have to use ChatGPT for it.

This repository is my personal collection of handy notes, code snippets, and solutions that I've gathered while learning and working on the MERN stack. If you're new to MERN or just need a quick reference, feel free to explore and use these resources.

Tech Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
Purpose: To document and share practical examples and shortcuts for the MERN stack.
Audience: Beginners like me who want to simplify their coding journey.
Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
