Yeah! I’m a noob, especially in Full-Stack Development. One day, I thought, “Why not make some notes and quick snippets so I don’t have to bug ChatGPT every time?” 😅 So, here we are!

This repository is like my personal treasure of notes, code snippets, and hilarious solutions I’ve stumbled upon while learning full-stack development. 
If you’re as new to full-stack as I am, or just need a quick laugh while coding, dive right in! 🏊‍♂️

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Here’re technologies I’m struggling with:

- **Frontend:** React, Angular, Vue.js – because one framework is never enough! 😜
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Django, Flask – basically, the headache for making things work.
- **Database:** MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite – because we all need a place to store our data.
- **Other Cool Stuff:** GraphQL, REST APIs, Docker, Kubernetes – because all these terms make you sound like a pro.

## 📚 Purpose

Nothing, Just a lazy coder's stuff.

## 🧑‍💻 Audience

Noobs like me.
